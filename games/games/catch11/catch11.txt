The fox has to catch the rabbit in 100 moves on a 11x11 board.
Each can move one step horizontally or vertically or none (noop) per move (not diagonally).
The fox catched the rabbit when they are side by side or on top of each other.
In the middle there is a blocked field, which one can not move into.
